This is a central repository for code, materials, resources, and preprints of my publications. Any and all material that can be made available will (eventually) be here. This is, as one would hope, an ever-expanding list. Each subsection below briefly describes and then links to the individual projects for publications.


## TCATA

Correspondence analysis-based methods to highlight and correct for temporal confounds in a temporal check-all-that-apply (TCATA) experiment (often used in food perception studies).
