Publications
================

This is a central repository for code, materials, resources, and
preprints of my publications. Any and all material that can be made
available will (eventually) be here. This is, as one would hope, an
ever-expanding list. Each subsection below briefly describes and then
links to the individual projects for publications.

## TCATA

Correspondence analysis-based methods to highlight and correct for
temporal confounds in a temporal check-all-that-apply (TCATA) experiment
(often used in food perception studies).

[You can find the TCATA materials here.](./TCATA_TemporalConfounds/)

## PLSCA

Partial least squares correspondence analysis and materials associated
with the *PsyMet* paper.

[You can find the PLSCA materials here.](./PsyMet_2015)

## CSDA (ExPosition)

Materials for the original ExPosition paper (which introduces the ideas
behind the software and the software itself).
